	Abstract = {We present algorithms for fast and stable approximation of the Hermite transform of a compactly supported function on the real line, attainable via an application of a fast algebraic algorithm for computing sums associated with a three-term relation. Trade-offs between approximation in bandlimit (in the Hermite sense), and size of the support region are addressed. Numerical experiments are presented that show the feasibility and utility of our approach. Generalizations to any family of orthogonal polynomials are outlined. Applications to various problems in tomographic reconstruction, including the determination of protein structure, are discussed. },

	Abstract = {A dynamical system governing the interaction of N point dipoles is derived. The resulting equations of motion for the dipolesÊ¼ positions and orientations reflect that (i) each dipole has a self-induced velocity and is advected by the local fluid velocity induced by other dipoles and (ii) each dipole tries to align itself in response to the local flow gradient. We discuss two dipole systems that differ only by the detail of how an individual dipole aligns itself with the local flow gradient. One system is consistent with the finite-dipole model based on constrained vortex pairs described in Tchieu et al (2012 Proc. R. Lond. A 468 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2012.0119] 3006--26 ) and Tsang and Kanso (2013 J. Nonlinear Sci. 23 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00332-013-9174-5] 971--91 ). The other system turns out to be consistent with the so-called JefferyÊ¼s equations for elongated bodies in viscous shear flows. For each system, we examine in detail the dynamic interactions of two dipoles, comparing and contrasting their behavior as a function of initial conditions. We find that the two dipoles exhibit regular behavior consisting of either colliding, synchronizing or diverging trajectories depending on their relative spacing and relative orientation.},

More complicated singularities correspond to vorticity point dipoles. It has been proved that point multipoles of a higher order (quadrupoles and more) are not the exact solutions of two-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics. The motion equations for a system of interacting point vortices and point dipoles have been obtained. It is shown that these equations are Hamiltonian ones and have three motion integrals in involution. It means the complete integrability of two-particle system, which has a point vortex and a point dipole. },

@article{TchieuKansoNewton2012,
	Abstract = {The notion of a finite dipole is introduced as a pair of equal and opposite strength point vortices (i.e. a vortex dipole) separated by a finite distance. Equations of motion for N finite dipoles interacting in an unbounded inviscid fluid are derived from the modified interaction of 2N independent vortices subject to the constraint that the inter-vortex spacing of each constrained dipole, â„“, remains constant. In the absence of all other dipoles and background flow, a single dipole moves in a straight line along the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the two point vortices comprising the dipole, with a self-induced velocity inversely proportional to â„“. When more than one dipole is present, the velocity of the dipole centre is the sum of the self-induced velocity and the average of the induced velocities on each vortex comprising the pair due to all the other dipoles. Each dipole orients in the direction of shear gradient based on the difference in velocities on each of the two vortices in the pair. Several numerical experiments are shown to illustrate the interactions between two and three dipoles in abreast and tandem configurations. We also show that equilibria (multi-poles) can form as a result of the interactions, and we study the stability of polygonal equilibria, showing that the N=3 case is linearly stable, whereas the N>3 case is linearly unstable.},

@article{Smith2011,
	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the description of the motion of singularities, such as point vortices, in two-dimensional inviscid and incompressible flows. One of the classical results of ideal hydrodynamics states that the self-induction term vanishes in the equations describing the motion of point vortices. The author reviews various arguments which have been invoked to arrive at this result, starting with the seminal work of Kirchhoff from 1876 (the excerpts of which are translated in an appendix). The motion of more general singularities, including point sinks/sources and dipoles, is also considered, highlighting difficulties inherent in descriptions based on classical arguments. It is demonstrated that a mathematically consistent account of their motion can be obtained using a suitably generalized momentum argument. The paper also describes the history of the derivation of the Brown--Michael equation applicable in situations when the vortex circulation changes in time. },

It is shown that collapse to a point in a finite time may occur for two identical point vortex quadrupoles when the initial distance between the quadrupoles is less than a certain critical value, which is independent of the size of the relevant elliptical vortices and is determined solely by the ratio of the intensity of the quadrupole component to the circulation of the vortex quadrupole. The dynamics equations for vortex quadrupoles are generalized with due account for the effect of molecular viscosity and Ekman friction. The effect of these dissipative factors on the dynamics and collapse of the vortex objects is assessed. },

	Abstract = { The authors devise a vortex method to solve two-dimensional Euler equations for incompressible inviscid flow. Their method provides higher-order accuracy on nonuniform meshes and was introduced by Nicolaides [Appl. Numer. Math. 2 (1986), no. 3-5, 313--320; MR0863990 (87k:65119)]. The vortex method is based on tracking a number of fluid particles by determining their velocities. The vorticity is approximated by a linear combination of Dirac delta functions. To achieve higher accuracy, this new vortex dipole method also uses the derivatives of the vorticity distribution in its numerical integration. A complete error estimation for the algorithm on an arbitrary mesh under regularity assumptions is provided, using the Sobolev space technique of P.-A. Raviart [in Numerical methods in fluid dynamics (Como, 1983), 243--324, Lecture Notes in Math., 1127, Springer, Berlin, 1985; MR0802214 (87h:76010)]. Nine theorems are proved which establish the higher-order properties for both the consistency error and stability error.

We present in explicit form a large class of exact localized stationary solutions for 2D Euler equations with a singularity whose index is equal to 3.

	Abstract = {We propose a quantitative criterion for the merging of a pair of equal two-dimensional co-rotating vortices. A cross-validation between experimental and theoretical analyses is performed. Experimental vortices are generated by the roll-up of a vortex sheet originating from the identical and impulsive rotation of two plates. The phenomenon is then followed up in time until a rapid pairing transition occurs for which critical parameters are measured. In the theoretical approach, the nonlinear Euler solution representing a pair of equal vortices is computed for various nonuniform vorticity distributions. The stability analysis of such a configuration then provides critical values for the onset of merging. From this data set, a criterion depending on global impulse quantities is extracted for different shapes of the vorticity distribution.

	Abstract = {This article deals with the interaction of co-rotating vortices, in configurations similar to those found in the extended near-wake of typical transport aircraft. The fundamental process of vortex merging is analyzed and modeled in detail in a two-dimensional context, giving insight into the conditions for merging and its physical origin, and yielding predictions for the resulting flow. Three-dimensional effects, in the form an elliptic short-wave instability arising in the initial co-rotating vortex flow, are described and analyzed theoretically. They are found to cause significant changes in the merging process, such as earlier merging and larger final vortex cores. Illustrations from recent experimental, numerical and theoretical studies are given, and the relevance of the results for applications to real aircraft wakes is discussed. {\copyright} 2005 Acad{\'e}mie des sciences.

	Abstract = {One of the main purposes in computational anatomy is the measurement and statistical study of anatomical variations in organs, notably in the brain or the heart. Over the last decade, our group has progressively developed several approaches for this problem, all related to the Riemannian geometry of groups of diffeomorphisms and the shape spaces on which these groups act. Several important shape evolution equations that are now used routinely in applications have emerged over time. Our goal in this paper is to provide an overview of these equations, placing them in their theoretical context, and giving examples of applications in which they can be used. We introduce the required theoretical background before discussing several classes of equations of increasingly complexity. These equations include energy minimizing evolutions deriving from Riemannian gradient descent, geodesics, parallel transport and Jacobi fields. },

For this we focus on two things: (i) the construction of bijections (via diffeomorphisms) between the coordinatized manifolds of human anatomy, and (ii) the transfer (group action and parallel transport) of functional information into anatomical atlases via these bijections. We review advances in the unification of the bijective comparison of anatomical submanifolds via point-sets including points, curves and surface triangulations as well as dense imagery. We examine the transfer via these bijections of functional response variables into anatomical coordinates via group action on scalars and matrices in \{DTI\} as well as parallel transport of metric information across multiple templates which preserves the inner product. },

   computational anatomy (CA). The model of CA is a Grenander deformable
   template, an orbit generated from a template under groups of

   constructed from the geodesic connecting one anatomical structure to
   another in the orbit. The variational problems specifying these metrics
   are reviewed along with their associated Euler-Lagrange equations. The
   Euler equations of motion derived by Arnold for the geodesics in the
   group of divergence-free volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of
   incompressible fluids are generalized for the larger group of
   diffeomorphisms used in CA with nonconstant Jacobians. Metrics that
   accommodate photometric variation are described extending the anatomical
   model to incorporate the construction of neoplasm. Metrics on landmarked
   shapes are reviewed as well as Joshi's diffeomorphism metrics,
   Bookstein's thin-plate spline approximate-metrics, and Kendall's affine
   invariant metrics. We conclude by showing recent experimental results

	Abstract = {Summary: "The Vlasov equation governs the evolution of the single-particle probability distribution function for a system of particles interacting without dissipation. Its singular solutions correspond to the individual particle motions. The operation of taking the moments of the Vlasov equation is a Poisson map. The resulting Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian dynamics of the Vlasov moments is found to be integrable in several cases. For example, the dynamics for casting beams in particle accelerators is associated by a hodograph transformation to the known integrable Benney shallow-water equation. After setting the context, the paper focuses on geodesic Vlasov moment equations. Continuum closures of these equations at two different orders are found to be integrable systems whose singular solutions characterize the geodesic motion of the individual particles.''},

	Abstract = {This article studies the use of moving, deforming elliptical Gaussian basis functions to compute the evolution of passive scalar quantities in a two-dimensional, incompressible flow field. We compute an evolution equation for the velocity, rotation, extension, and deformation of the computational elements as a function of flow quantities. We find that if one uses the physical flow velocity data calculated from the basis function centroid, the method has only second-order spatial accuracy. However, by computing the residual of the numerical method, we can determine adjustments to the centroid data so that the scheme will achieve fourth-order spatial accuracy. Simulations with nontrivial flow parameters demonstrate that the methods exhibit the properties predicted by theory.

@article{Leiderman2014,
	Abstract = {In the last decade numerous mathematical models have been formulated to investigate specific components of the clotting system such as the tissue factor pathway of coagulation. Sophisticated, multiscale models were developed to better understand the interplay of flow-mediated transport, platelet deposition, and coagulation kinetics, and their overall effect on thrombus formation. Promotion of thrombus growth is partially due to the well-known pro-coagulant roles of platelets like the surface-dependent coagulation reactions. Iterations of theoretical model predictions and experiment have helped to elucidate anticoagulant roles of platelets as well. These roles include paving over the subendothelium and hindering transport of substrates to and from enzyme complexes which can strongly affect thrombus formation. In this review, we give a brief overview of theoretical models of thrombus formation under flow and some of the experiments that motivated them and were motivated by them.},

	Abstract = {In this paper the dynamics of three point vortices in the plane is analysed in terms of Nambu mechanics and compared to the classical Hamiltonian dynamics. Two new aspects are introduced: (i) the motion of three point vortices can be classified as non-canonical Nambu mechanics and (ii) Nambu mechanics leads to a geometric representation of the trajectories in an adapted three-dimensional phase space without explicitly solving the differential equations. Thereby, the point vortex trajectory is given by the intersection of two conserved quantities as surfaces in the phase space. These constitutive quantities are the total energy and an angular momentum based Casimir function of the dynamical system. The topological structure of the last surface represents a one- or two- sheeted hyperboloid, a cone or an ellipsoid in the phase space. Examples of the periodic motion and a novel aspect of the collapse of three point vortices in the unbounded plane are discussed. Furthermore, an approach to generalize Nambu mechanics for an arbitrary number of point vortices is proposed.},

	Abstract = {Animal movements result from a complex balance of many different forces. Muscles produce force to move the body; the body has inertial, elastic, and damping properties that may aid or oppose the muscle force; and the environment produces reaction forces back on the body. The actual motion is an emergent property of these interactions. To examine the roles of body stiffness, muscle activation, and fluid environment for swimming animals, a computational model of a lamprey was developed. The model uses an immersed boundary framework that fully couples the Navier--Stokes equations of fluid dynamics with an actuated, elastic body model. This is the first model at a Reynolds number appropriate for a swimming fish that captures the complete fluid-structure interaction, in which the body deforms according to both internal muscular forces and external fluid forces. Results indicate that identical muscle activation patterns can produce different kinematics depending on body stiffness, and the optimal value of stiffness for maximum acceleration is different from that for maximum steady swimming speed. Additionally, negative muscle work, observed in many fishes, emerges at higher tail beat frequencies without sensory input and may contribute to energy efficiency. Swimming fishes that can tune their body stiffness by appropriately timed muscle contractions may therefore be able to optimize the passive dynamics of their bodies to maximize peak acceleration or swimming speed.},

@article{McMillen2008,
	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In this article we develop a computationally tractable model for swimming in animals such as eels, lampreys, and aquatic snakes. The model combines motoneuronal activation, muscle dynamics, passive elasticity and damping in the spinal cord and body tissues, and simplified hydrodynamic reaction forces, thus allowing us to probe how neuromechanical interactions give rise to body shapes and, ultimately, motion through the water. We use it to investigate the sources of an interesting experimental observation in freely swimming fish: that waves of curvature propagating along the body lag behind and travel more slowly than the muscular activation waves measured by electromyography. By selectively ``lesioning'' components of the model, we deduce that the speed difference, at least in this type of fish, is largely due to passive viscoelasticity and body geometry. We also find that nonlinear muscle properties are responsible for a significant reduction in energy expenditure and that they can also contribute to the wave speed difference. This work is a key step in a general program to build integrated ``whole animal'' models of locomotion and other behaviors that will also allow us to incorporate proprioceptive and exteroceptive neural feedback. Such integrated models can contribute both to our understanding of how living systems work and to the further development of robot systems.</p>

@article{OlascoagaHaller2012,
	Abstract = {The lack of reliable forecasts for the spread of oceanic and atmospheric contamination hinders the effective protection of the ecosystem, society, and the economy from the fallouts of environmental disasters. The consequences can be dire, as evidenced by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. We present a methodology to predict major short-term changes in environmental contamination patterns, such as oil spills in the ocean and ash clouds in the atmosphere. Our approach is based on new mathematical results on the objective (frame-independent) identification of key material surfaces that drive tracer mixing in unsteady, finite-time flow data. Some of these material surfaces, known as Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), turn out to admit highly attracting cores that lead to inevitable material instabilities even under future uncertainties or unexpected perturbations to the observed flow. These LCS cores have the potential to forecast imminent shape changes in the contamination pattern, even before the instability builds up and brings large masses of water or air into motion. Exploiting this potential, the LCS-core analysis developed here provides a model-independent forecasting scheme that relies only on already observed or validated flow velocities at the time the prediction is made. We use this methodology to obtain high-precision forecasts of two major instabilities that occurred in the shape of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This is achieved using simulated surface currents preceding the prediction times and assuming that the oil behaves as a passive tracer.},

	Abstract = {{Summary: This paper discusses the mathematical framework for
    designing methods of Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Matching (LDM) for
    image registration in computational anatomy. After reviewing the geometrical
    framework of LDM image registration methods, we prove a theorem showing that
    these methods may be designed by using the actions of diffeomorphisms on the
    image data structure to define their associated momentum representations as
    (cotangent-lift) momentum maps. To illustrate its use, the momentum map
    theorem is shown to recover the known algorithms for matching landmarks,
    scalar images, and vector fields. After briefly discussing the use of this
    approach for diffusion tensor (DT) images, we explain how to use momentum
    maps in the design of registration algorithms for more general data
    structures. For example, we extend our methods to determine the
    corresponding momentum map for registration using semidirect product groups,
    for the purpose of matching images at two different length scales. Finally,
    we discuss the use of momentum maps in the design of image registration
    algorithms when the image data is defined on manifolds instead of vector
    spaces.}},

	Abstract = {In some previous papers, a geometric description of Lagrangian mechanics on Lie algebroids has been developed. In this topical review, we give a Hamiltonian description of mechanics on Lie algebroids. In addition, we introduce the notion of a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic Lie algebroid and we prove that the Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) dynamics on Lie algebroids may be described in terms of Lagrangian submanifolds of symplectic Lie algebroids. The Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) formalism on Lie algebroids permits us to deal with Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) functions not defined necessarily on tangent (cotangent) bundles. Thus, we may apply our results to the projection of Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) functions which are invariant under the action of a symmetry Lie group. As a consequence, we obtain that Lagrange--Poincar{\'e} (Hamilton--Poincar{\'e}) equations are the Euler--Lagrange (Hamilton) equations associated with the corresponding Atiyah algebroid. Moreover, we prove that Lagrange--Poincar{\'e} (Hamilton--Poincar{\'e}) equations are the local equations defining certain Lagrangian submanifolds of symplectic Atiyah algebroids.},

We regard the internal configuration of a deformable body, together with its position and orientation in ambient space, as a point in a trivial principal fiber bundle over the manifold of body deformations. We obtain connections on such bundles which describe the nonholonomic constraints, conservation laws, and force balances to which certain propulsors are subject, and contruct and analyze control-affine normal forms for different classes of systems. We examine the applicability of results involving geometric phases to the practical computation of trajectories for systems described by single connections. We propose a model for planar carangiform swimming based on reduced Euler-Lagrange equations for the interaction of a rigid body and an incompressible fluid, accounting for the generation of thrust due to vortex shedding through controlled coupling terms. We investigate the correct form of this coupling experimentally with a robotic propulsor, comparing its observed behavior with that predicted numerically. },

@article{Liao2003b,
	Abstract = {{Most fishes commonly experience unsteady flows and hydrodynamic
   perturbations during their lifetime. In this study, we provide evidence
   that rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss voluntarily alter their body
   kinematics when interacting with vortices present in the environment
   that are not self-generated. To demonstrate this, we measured axial
   swimming kinematics in response to changes in known hydrodynamic wake
   characteristics. We compared trout swimming in the Karman street behind
   different diameter cylinders (2.5 and 5 cm) at two flow speeds (2.5 and
   4.5 L s(-1), where L is total body length) to trout swimming in the free
   stream and in the cylinder bow wake. Trout swimming behind cylinders
   adopt a distinctive, previously undescribed pattern of movement in order
   to hold station, which we term the Karman gait. During this gait, body
   amplitudes and curvatures are much larger than those of trout swimming
   at an equivalent flow velocity in the absence of a cylinder. Tail-beat
   frequency is not only lower than might be expected for a trout swimming
   in the reduced flow behind a cylinder, but also matches the vortex
   shedding frequency of the cylinder. Therefore, in addition to choosing
   to be in the slower flow velocity offered behind a cylinder (drafting),
   trout are also altering their body kinematics to synchronize with the
   shed vortices (tuning), using a mechanism that may not involve
   propulsive locomotion. This behavior is most distinctive when cylinder
   diameter is large relative to fish length. While tuning, trout have a
   longer body wavelength than the prescribed wake wavelength, indicating
   that only certain regions of the body may need to be oriented in a
   consistent manner to the oncoming vortices. Our results suggest that
   fish can capture energy from vortices generated by the environment to
   maintain station in downstream flow. Interestingly, trout swimming in
   front of a cylinder display lower tail-beat amplitudes and body wave
   speeds than trout subjected to any of the other treatments, implying
   that the bow wake may be the most energetically favorable region for a
   fish to hold station near a cylinder.}},

@article{Kanso2005,
	Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with modeling the dynamics of N articulated
   solid bodies submerged in an ideal fluid. The model is used to analyze
   the locomotion of aquatic animals due to the coupling between their
   shape changes and the fluid dynamics in their environment.
   The equations of motion are obtained by making use of a two-stage
   reduction process which leads to significant mathematical and
   computational simplifications. The first reduction exploits particle
   relabeling symmetry: that is, the symmetry associated with the
   conservation of circulation for ideal, incompressible fluids. As a
   result, the equations of motion for the submerged solid bodies can be
   formulated without explicitly incorporating the fluid variables. This
   reduction by the fluid variables is a key difference with earlier
   methods, and it is appropriate since one is mainly interested in the
   location of the bodies, not the fluid particles.
   The second reduction is associated with the invariance of the dynamics
   under superimposed rigid motions. This invariance corresponds to the
   conservation of total momentum of the solid-fluid system. Due to this
   symmetry, the net locomotion of the solid system is realized as the sum
   of geometric and dynamic phases over the shape space consisting of
   allowable relative motions, or deformations, of the solids. In
   particular, reconstruction equations that govern the net locomotion at
   zero momentum, that is, the geometric phases, are obtained.
   As an illustrative example, a planar three-link mechanism is shown to
   propel and steer itself at zero momentum by periodically changing its
   shape. Two solutions are presented: one corresponds to a
   hydrodynamically decoupled mechanism and one is based on accurately
   computing the added inertias using a boundary element method. The
   hydrodynamically decoupled model produces smaller net motion than the
   more accurate model, indicating that it is important to consider the
   hydrodynamic interaction of the links.}},

Fluid Mech. 506, 147--155] has shown that an axle-mounted blade can spontaneously rotate when oscillated (or  '' flapped'') above a critical frequency in a fluid. To understand the nature of flapping locomotion we study numerically the dynamics of a simple body, flapped up and down within a viscous fluid and free to move horizontally. We show here that, at sufficiently large  '' frequency Reynolds number,'' unidirectional locomotion emerges as an attracting state for an initially nonlocomoting body. Locomotion is generated in two stages: first, the fluid field loses symmetry by an instability similar to the classical von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n instability; and second, precipitous interactions with previously shed vortical structures  '' push'' the body into locomotion. Body mass and slenderness play central and unexpected roles in each stage. Conceptually, this work demonstrates how locomotion can be transduced from the simple oscillations of a body through an interaction with its fluid environment.}},

@article{YoMa2007b,
	Abstract = {This paper develops a reduction theory for Dirac structures that includes, in a unified way, reduction of both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems. It includes the reduction of variational principles and in particular, the Hamilton-Pontryagin variational principle. It also includes reduction theory for implicit Lagrangian systems that could be degenerate and have constraints.

In this paper we focus on the special case in which the configuration manifold is a Lie group G. In our earlier papers we established the link between the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle and Dirac structures. We begin the paper with the reduction of this principle. The traditional view of Poisson reduction in this case is to reduce T*G with its natural Poisson structure to g * with its Lie-Poisson structure. However, the basic step of reducing Hamilton's phase space principle already shows that it is important to use g â€š{\"a}{\"\i} g * for the reduced space, rather than just g * . In this way, our construction includes both Euler-Poincarâˆš{\copyright} as well as Lie-Poisson reduction. The geometry behind this procedure, which we call Lie-Dirac reduction starts with the standard (i.e., canonical) Dirac structure on T*G (which can be viewed either symplectically or from the Poisson viewpoint) and for each {\OE}Âº â€š{\`a}{\`a} g * , produces a Dirac structure on g â€š{\"a}{\"\i} g * . This geometry then simultaneously supports both Euler-Poincarâˆš{\copyright} and Lie-Poisson reduction.

In the last part of the paper, we include nonholonomic constraints, and illustrate this construction with Suslov systems in nonholonomic mechanics, both from the Euler-Poincarâˆš{\copyright} and Lie-Poisson viewpoints.},

@article{YoMa2006b,
	Abstract = {Part I of this paper introduced the notion of implicit Lagrangian systems and their geometric structure was explored in the context of Dirac structures. In this part, we develop the variational structure of implicit Lagrangian systems. Specifically, we show that the implicit Eulerâ€š{\"A}{\`\i}Lagrange equations can be formulated using an extended variational principle of Hamilton called the Hamiltonâ€š{\"A}{\`\i}Pontryagin principle. This variational formulation incorporates, in a natural way, the generalized Legendre transformation, which enables one to treat degenerate Lagrangian systems. The definition of this generalized Legendre transformation makes use of natural maps between iterated tangent and cotangent spaces. Then, we develop an extension of the classical Lagrangeâ€š{\"A}{\`\i}dâ€š{\"A}{\^o}Alembert principle called the Lagrangeâ€š{\"A}{\`\i}dâ€š{\"A}{\^o}Alembertâ€š{\"A}{\`\i}Pontryagin principle for implicit Lagrangian systems with constraints and external forces. A particularly interesting case is that of nonholonomic mechanical systems that can have both constraints and external forces. In addition, we define a constrained Dirac structure on the constraint momentum space, namely the image of the Legendre transformation (which, in the degenerate case, need not equal the whole cotangent bundle). We construct an implicit constrained Lagrangian system associated with this constrained Dirac structure by making use of an Ehresmann connection. Two examples, namely a vertical rolling disk on a plane and an L â€š{\"A}{\`\i} C circuit are given to illustrate the results.},

@article{Gawlik2011,
	Abstract = {This study derives geometric, variational discretizations of continuum theories arising in fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and the dynamics of complex fluids. A central role in these discretizations is played by the geometric formulation of fluid dynamics, which views solutions to the governing equations for perfect fluid flow as geodesics on the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain. Inspired by this framework, we construct a finite-dimensional approximation to the diffeomorphism group and its Lie algebra, thereby permitting a variational temporal discretization of geodesics on the spatially discretized diffeomorphism group. The extension to MHD and complex fluid flow is then made through an appeal to the theory of Euler-Poincar\'{e} systems with advection, which provides a generalization of the variational formulation of ideal fluid flow to fluids with one or more advected parameters. Upon deriving a family of structured integrators for these systems, we test their performance via a numerical implementation of the update schemes on a cartesian grid. Among the hallmarks of these new numerical methods are exact preservation of momenta arising from symmetries, automatic satisfaction of solenoidal constraints on vector fields, good long-term energy behavior, robustness with respect to the spatial and temporal resolution of the discretization, and applicability to irregular meshes.},
