\section{Sparsity}
  Given an arbitrary function $f \in C^{\infty}(M)$, it's notable that the support of $D_X f$ is a subset of the support of $f$.
  Therefore, the proportion of non-zero entries of $[X]$ is bounded by the number of non-zero elements $\langle \psi_\lambda , \psi_\mu \rangle$.
  The next theorem gives us a bound on the number of non-zero entries of $[X]$ based upon this observation.
  
  \begin{theorem}
  Assume the vector-field $X$ is supported on a subset of $[-L,L]^d \subset \mathbb{R}^d$.
  Let $\aleph( [X]^{(j)})$ denote the number of non-zero entries of $[X]^{(j)}$.  Then
  \[
  	\aleph( [X]^{(j)} ) \leq \frac{2 S }{2^{j+1}L + S}
  \]
  where $S$ is the length of the support of the scaling function for our wavelet basis.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
  We will denote the cardinality of a set by $\aleph( \cdot )$.
  It is simple to verify that
  \[
  	\aleph \{ i \in \mathbb{N} \mid {\rm supp}( \phi_{j,k} ) \cap {\rm supp}( \phi_{j,k} ) \neq \null \}
  \]
  is bounded by $2M^d$.
  As we are only interested in functions over the support of $X$, we are curious about the quantity
  \[
  	\aleph \{ i \in \mathbb{N} \mid {\rm supp}( \phi_{j,i} ) \cap [-L,L]^d \neq \null \}.
  \]
  We can verify that this quantity is bounded by $(2^{j+1}L+S)^d$.
  We can then consider a matrix of size $(2^{j+1} L + S) \times (2^{j+1} L + S )$.
  A cap on the proportion of non-zero entries is then given by  $\frac{2 S }{2^{j+1}L + S}$
  
  \end{proof}
