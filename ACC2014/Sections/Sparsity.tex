\section{Sparsity}
  Given an arbitrary function $f \in C^{\infty}(M)$, it's notable that the support of $D_X f$ is a subset of the support of $f$.
  Therefore, the proportion of non-zero entries of $[X]$ is bounded by the number of non-zero elements $\langle \psi_\lambda , \psi_\mu \rangle$.
  The next theorem gives us a bound on the number of non-zero entries of $[X]$ based upon this observation.
  
  \begin{theorem}
