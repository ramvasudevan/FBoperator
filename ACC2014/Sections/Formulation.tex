\section{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:Formulation}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define our system and the problem under consideration
	\item Define our half density advection equation
	\item Formalize the relationship between half density advection equation and trajectories of the system
	\item Formalize properties of the advection equation (like mass preserving and anti-hermitian)
\end{enumerate}
