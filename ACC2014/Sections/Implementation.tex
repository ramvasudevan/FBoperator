\section{Numerical Implementation}\label{sec:Implementation}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define wavelet bases
	\item Define the finite dimensional representation
	\item Properties of finite dimensional representation (anti-hermitian and rate of convergence of operator)
	\item Advection of densities belonging to our density space is closed
	\item Convergence rate
	\item Thresholding argument?
\end{enumerate}

Let $\Psi_1, \Psi_2, \dots$ be a Shuader basis for $\mathcal{H}$, where one should imaging that these basis elements are ordered by increasing irregularity.
