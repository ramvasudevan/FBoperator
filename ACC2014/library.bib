	Abstract = {Bevel-tip flexible needles have greater mobility than straight rigid
	needles, and can be used to reach targets behind sensitive or impenetrable
	areas. Accurately planning and executing the optimal motions for
	such steerable needles is difficult, however, and requires solving
	inverse kinematics for a nonholonomic system.This paper presents
	an approach to 3D motion planning for bevel-tip needles in an environment
	with obstacles. Instead of discretizing the configuration space as
	in earlier work, we discretize the control space, such that the trajectory
	of the needle can be expressed analytically without the need for
	approximate numerical simulation. This results in a fast optimization
	routine that finds a locally optimal path in a 3D environment with
	obstacles, requiring just a few seconds of computation time on a
	standard PC.We introduce two different discretization strategies
	that lead to differently structured paths and show that both produce
	valid trajectories from start to goal. To our knowledge, the presented
	method is the first to address motion planning for bevel-tip needles
	in a 3D environment with obstacles.},

	Abstract = {Physicians perform percutaneous therapies in many diagnostic and therapeutic
	procedures. Image guidance promises to improve targeting accuracy
	and broaden the scope of needle interventions. In this paper, we
	consider the possibility of automating the guidance of a flexible
	bevel-tip needle as it is inserted into human tissue. We build upon
	a previously proposed nonholonomic kinematic model to develop a nonlinear
	observer-based controller. As a first step for control, we show that
	flexible needles can be automatically controlled to remain within
	a planar slice of tissue as they are inserted by a physician; our
	approach keeps the physician in the loop to control insertion speed.
	In the proposed controller, the distance of the needle tip position
	from the plane of interest is used as a feedback signal. Numerical
	simulations demonstrate the stability and robustness of the controller
	in the face of parametric uncertainty. We also present results from
	pilot physical experiments with phantom tissue under stereo image
	guidance.},

@article{Li2009,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a unified computational method based on
	pseudospectral approximations for the design of optimal pulse sequences
	in open quantum systems. The proposed method transforms the problem
	of optimal pulse design, which is formulated as a continuous time
	optimal control problem, to a finite dimensional constrained nonlinear
	programming problem. This resulting optimization problem can then
	be solved using existing numerical optimization suites. We apply
	the Legendre pseudospectral method to a series of optimal control
	problems on open quantum systems that arise in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
	(NMR) spectroscopy in liquids. These problems have been well studied
	in previous literature and analytical optimal controls have been
	found. We find an excellent agreement between the maximum transfer
	efficiency produced by our computational method and the analytical
	expressions. Moreover, our method permits us to extend the analysis
	and address practical concerns, including smoothing discontinuous
	controls as well as deriving minimum energy controls. The method
	is not restricted to the systems studied in this article but is universal
	to every open quantum system whose performance is limited by dissipation.},

@article{Srinivasan2006,
	Abstract = {Although people's legs are capable of a broad range of muscle-use
	and gait patterns, they generally prefer just two. They walk, swinging
	their body over a relatively straight leg with each step, or run,
	bouncing up off a bent leg between aerial phases. Walking feels easiest
	when going slowly, and running feels easiest when going faster. More
	unusual gaits seem more tiring. Perhaps this is because walking and
	running use the least energy. Addressing this classic conjecture
	with experiments requires comparing walking and running with many
	other strange and unpractised gaits. As an alternative, a basic understanding
	of gait choice might be obtained by calculating energy cost by using
	mechanics-based models. Here we use a minimal model that can describe
	walking and running as well as an infinite variety of other gaits.
	We use computer optimization to find which gaits are indeed energetically
	optimal for this model. At low speeds the optimization discovers
	the classic inverted-pendulum walk, at high speeds it discovers a
	bouncing run, even without springs, and at intermediate speeds it
	finds a new pendular-running gait that includes walking and running
	as extreme cases.},
